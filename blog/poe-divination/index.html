                    <h1>Chinese Moon Blocks</h1>
                    <em>12 December 2021, 6 mins read</em>
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I am of Chinese descent and there is this tradition that my older relatives at home do, known as 擲筊 or Poe Divination / Chinese Moon Blocks, to seek divine guidance and get "Yes" or "No" answers from the Gods.</p><br>
                    <p>There are two moon-shaped blocks made of wood, each one with one curved and one flat surface. To use it, one holds both blocks in their hands and ask the questions in their heart, then throw the blocks on the floor.</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If both blocks show the flat side up, it's a "laughing answer" (笑筊) or known as the Gods are laughing the question off. In this case, usually a re-throw will be performed.</li><br>
                        <li>If both blocks show the flat side down, it's a "crying answer" (哭筊) or a "No".</li><br>
                        <li>If the blocks show a flat side and a curved side each, it's a "divine answer" (聖筊) or a "Yes".</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While looking at the people performing this ritual, I wonder to myself, what actually are the odds? In particular, (1) what is the probability of getting a Flat from one block? and (2) how does the re-throw affect the final outcome?</p><br>

                    <figure>
                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/poe-divination/img/moon-blocks.jpeg" alt="" width=auto height=300px></p><br>

                    </figure>

                    <h3>One Block</h3>
                    <p>This scenario is exactly the same as using a coin, just different probabilities. Research has shown that moon blocks have around 5% deviation from zero mean, which means that there is a 45%-55% chance that it will land on the Flat face.</p><br>

                    <h3>Simulation</h3>
                    <p>Suppose \(q\) is the probability of landing with the Flat face pointing downwards. \(q\) will take values from 0.01 to 1, with increment of 0.01.</p><br>
                    <p>A <code>throw</code> function is created to simulate one throw of a pair of moon blocks. With the aforementioned scenarios, i.e. both Flats pointing up/down, and one up one down, the <code>throw</code> function tags them as "Yes", "No", or "Laugh". If a "Laugh" is thrown, a re-throw will be performed. This simulation will run for \(n=1000\) iterations, and the sum of "Yes" will be recorded.</p><br>

                    <pre><code>
throw <- function(q){

  # initialize throw
  outcome = "Laugh"

  # repeat throws if "Laugh" is obtained, until "Yes" or "No" is obtained
  while (outcome == "Laugh"){

    # randomly simulate block throw outcomes
    # probability q of Flat pointing downwards
    # probability 1-q of Flat pointing upwards
    block1 = ifelse(runif(1)>q, "FlatUp", "FlatDown")
    block2 = ifelse(runif(1)>q, "FlatUp", "FlatDown")

    # determine final outcome depending on both blocks
    # Both FlatUp = "Laugh"
    # Both FlatDown = "No"
    # A FlatUp and A FlatDown = "Yes"
    outcome = ifelse(block1 == "FlatUp" & block2 == "FlatUp", "Laugh",
                     ifelse(block1 == "FlatDown" & block2 == "FlatDown", "No", "Yes"))
  }

  return(outcome)
}
                      </code></pre>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>As the value of \(q\) increases, it is observed that the proportion of "Yes" decreases, in other words the proportion of "No" increases, as Flat sides tend to be downwards and result in "No".</p><br>
                    <p>It is also observed that when \(q = 0.50\), proportion of "Yes" is approximately \(0.67\) or \(2/3\).</p><br>

                    <pre><code>
# list of probabilities q (in %)
# exclude 0% because the outcome will always be "Laugh" which results in a re-throw
q = seq(0.01,1.00,0.01)

# number of iterations
iter = 1000

# matrix to store
outcome_matrix = matrix(rep(0, length(q)*iter), ncol=length(q), nrow=iter)
colnames(outcome_matrix) = q
rownames(outcome_matrix) = 1:iter
count = rep(0,length(q))

for (j in 1:length(q)){

  for (i in 1:iter){
    # categorize outcome as binary
    outcome_matrix[i,j] = ifelse(throw(q[j])=="Yes",1,0)
  }

  # count number of "Yes"'s
  count[j] = sum(outcome_matrix[,j])

}

# calculate probability of "Yes" for each value of q
probability = count / iter
plot(q, probability)

# probability of "Yes" if the moon blocks have equal probability of landing "FlatUp" or "FlatDown"
probability[length(q)/2]

                    <h3>Calculations</h3>
                    <p>Suppose \(1\) is a FlatUp, \(0\) is a FlatDown, and \(q = 0.50\). The sample space for the throw of a pair of moon blocks is \({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}\). The \((0, 1)\) or \((1, 0)\) "Yes" scenarios have probability \(2/4\) respectively, \((1, 1)\) "Laugh" re-throw and \((0, 0)\) "No" has probability \(1/4\) respectively.</p><br>
                    <p>When a "Laugh" is encountered, the re-throw will repeat until we reach a "Yes" or a "No", which means the probability of getting a "Yes" is the sum of a geometric progression with initial term \(1/2\), common ratio \(1/4\), and an infinite number of terms. Therefore, the sum is \(2/3\).</p><br>
                    <p>Using a Binomial probability function, we can also show that with 2 trials (as in 2 moon blocks), 1 success, and 0.5 success probability (as in one FlatUp and one FlatDown to result in a "Yes"), the chances of getting a "Yes" is \(P(n = 2, x = 1, q = 0.5) = nCx * q * (1 - q) = 0.5\)</p><br>
                    <p>Suppose \(p\) is the probability of only "Yes" (excluding "Laugh"), we can also plot of graph of \(q\) against \(p\). It is observed that even when \(q\) fluctuates around \(0.40\) to \(0.60\), \(p\) will take value \(0.48\).</p><br>
                    <p>Furthermore, when \(q = 0.40\) and \(q = 0.60\), the simulated probability of "Yes" is still fairly high at approximately \(0.57\) to \(0.76\), only a difference of less than \(10\)% from when \(q = 0.50\).</p><br>

                    <pre><code>
plot(q, 2*q*(1-q), type="l")
abline(v=c(0.40, 0.60), col=c("red","green"), lty=c(2,2))
abline(h=c(0.48), col="blue", lty=2)

c(2*q[40]*(1-q[40]), 2*q[60]*(1-q[60]))
probability[c(40, 60)]
                    </code></pre>

                    <pre><codeoutput>
> c(2*q[40]*(1-q[40]), 2*q[60]*(1-q[60]))
[1] 0.48 0.48

> probability[c(40, 60)]
[1] 0.758 0.566
                    </codeoutput></pre>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/poe-divination/img/q_against_p.PNG" alt="" width=auto height=300px></p><br>

                    <h3>Other Scenarios</h3>
                    <p>Some people throw a Best of 3 or 3 consecutive "Yes" or "No" for the answer to count.</p><br>
                    <p>For a Best of 3, the outcome must be at least 2 "Yes". So, possible events are \(YYN\), \(YNY\), \(NYY\), and \(YYY\). Probability is \(3 * ((2/3)^2 * (1/3)) + (2/3)^3 = 20/27 ≈ 0.741\).</p><br>
                    <p>For 3 consecutive "Yes", the only possible event is \(YYY\) with probability \((2/3)^3 = 8/27 ≈ 0.296\).</p><br>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>From a mathematics perspective, it is definitely not a fair play with "Yes" appearing twice as many times as "No". Personally, I am not a believer, but from a believer's perspective, they might believe that there are external forces influencing the outcome. You do you.</p><br>
