                    <h1>Loss Prevention</h1>
                    <em>19 August 2021</em>
                    <em>5 mins read</em>

                    <h3>What is loss prevention?</h3>
                    <p>Loss prevention (also known as loss control) is a risk control action to prevent a risky event from happening. Under usual circumstances, stakeholders are willing to take on low risk for higher reward, where loss prevention measures are usually not required. In the case where high risk is involved, loss prevention methods are taken, e.g. automobile accidents and wildfires. In the two examples given, these loss prevention methods are taken by insurance companies. They prevent loss by providing aid or support to risk owners that they insure, to reduce the severity and frequency of claims or to totally prevent risky events from happening, in order to maximize profitability. Next, we will talk in details about how do they do that and what policies do they need to implement.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Automobile Accidents (profit-driven)</h3>
                    <p>Road accidents are extremely frequent and its severity can vary from a wide range. Examples of loss prevention for automobiles are auto safety features and mileage incentives.</p>
                    <p>Insurance companies encourage auto owners to install safety features as effective as possible (the term "effective" is used because using "more" might not increase the safety level, in fact it might be counterproductive). With the most effective safety features installed and everything else constant, drivers will have fewer accidents, and even if an accident happens, it will not be as severe.</p>
                    <p>With expected accident frequency and severity reduced, insurance companies can anticipate a reduction in claim frequency and amount, which indirectly contributes to an increase in profitability.</p>
                    <p>However, not all auto owners are financially comfortable to install safety features, given that most of the safety features out there are pricey due to them being mechanically and electronically fine-tuned. To convince auto owners to install the features, the marketing department of the insurer usually has to come up with attractive packages.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Wildfires (social-driven)</h3>
                    <p>Wildfires are seasonal, but most of the time can be human-caused, in fact 90% of the time. But wildfires are bound to happen when there are materials to burn, in this case, greens, which are efficient fuel, and of course oxygen. When the fuel are ready to be lit up, one human will just need to start a spark, be it due to arson or burning of debris.</p>
                    <p>Let's assume no one has the intention to start a fire near the wildfire-prone areas, however the fuel will still exist no matter what. In order to reduce or totally prevent the loss due to wildfires on the insured area, insurance companies come up with different initiative to prevent loss.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <h3>Examples of Loss Prevention</h3>
                    <p>Two examples are goat grazing and partnership with local fire department (or even establishing private fire departments). Goat grazing is a method of using goats to graze on the grass of the greens to reduce "fuel" which in turn reduces the severity of wildfire if it happens. However, this method requires a high set-up cost which includes fencing, geo-mapping, terrain analysis, and maintenance.​</p>
                    <p>Insurance companies also partner with the local fire department for swifter and better services. The companies invest in the tools and machines so that fires are put out quicker and severity is reduced, which means loss reduced and profitability increased for the insurer.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Insurance companies rely a lot on the quantitative framework approach to decide whether they want to invest in loss prevention services. From a profitability standpoint, insurers compare the cost of investing in loss prevention measures with the cost of claims to decide whether to carry out the measures. Insurance companies usually have their in-house or outsourced experts who have strong expertise in defining strengths and weaknesses of sites to support the risk-based decisions.</p>
                    <p>The above examples are the more visible examples. However, loss prevention is slowly expanding into the cybersecurity field, increasing possibilities of new insurance products and coverage, especially in the areas of fraud detection and security breach.</p>
