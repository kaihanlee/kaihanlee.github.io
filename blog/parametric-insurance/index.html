                    <h1>Parametric Insurance</h1>
                    <em>03 September 2021, 5 mins read</em>
                    <br><br>

                    <p>I came across this very interesting insurance product while I was reading some articles. I did some research about this and here's what I found out.</p><br>
                    <p>Parametric insurance is an insurance product that has pre-defined event parameters as triggers. When an agreed parameter (or index) is met, the pay-out will happen, regardless of the physical loss sustained.</p><br>
                    <p>Parametric insurance usually covers natural disasters and catastrophes because it relies on a triggering event, for example, windspeed of a certain value of kilometers per hour for a hurricane or a certain magnitude for an earthquake. But also note that, damage/loss does not need to sustain for pay-out to be valid.</p><br>
                    <p>These index triggers are usually detected by a third party and can be reported very quickly as parametric insurance does not require a loss assessment to be done. So generally the pay-out of a parametric insurance takes a shorter amount of time than other traditional insurance.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/parametric-insurance/img/main.jpg" alt=""></p><br>

                    <h3>Loss Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Traditional insurance pays out after actual physical loss is assessed by the insurer. Parametric insurance pays out once a pre-defined event is triggered. Technically, it is more liquid and should take a shorter amount of time to payout the pre-agreed amount of a parametric insurance than to reimburse the actual loss sustained, due to the time saved for loss assessment.</p><br>

                    <h3>Claims Process</h3>
                    <p>The process for a traditional insurance is fairly complex due to the completely different scenarios for every incident, and the claim amount needs to go through a round of assessment by loss adjusters. Whereas parametric insurance has a fairly simple and straightforward approach, the insurers just need to measure/verify the pre-agreed index from the data provided by a third party service provider, then the payout can happen.</p><br>

                    <h3>Structure</h3>
                    <p>Traditional insurance policies usually have standardized wordings, as it can be used to fit all if not most scenarios. Parametric insurance have pre-agreed index tailored to client's needs, and pay-out which is based on the chosen indices.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/parametric-insurance/img/1.jpg" alt="" width=auto height=300px></p><br>

                    <h3>Wildfires</h3>
                    <p>Parameters for wildfires include windspeed, temperature, rate of fire spread etc. These parameters can affect likelihood and severity of a wildfire event. The magnitude of the indices will likely affect the loss of the event, but even if they do not, the parameters will still be triggered regardless of whether an event happens or not. Insurance companies usually work with Geographic Information System Mapping (GIS) service providers to map targeted areas and they also work with Internet of Things (IoT) service providers to obtain data of the agreed indices (e.g. sensor readings of windspeed & temperature).</p><br>

                    <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
                    <p>Parametric insurance is very useful for windfarm construction clients. Windfarms are built at areas with strong wind, which has high risk of major extreme weather event happening. Parametric insurance coverage can help to mitigate this risk. The agreed indices may be hurricane categories (Cat 1, 2, or 3). On the other hand, if windspeed goes below the threshold, the windfarm might face a capacity issue where it is not able to produce the required amount of energy. This can also be a scenario where parametric insurance comes into play.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/parametric-insurance/img/2.jpg" alt=""></p><br>

                    <p>Parametric products are not very popular or well known in Malaysia, it is also a fairly new product. Parametric insurance is usually used to protect the insured against external forces that result in financial losses, as the examples above.</p><br>
                    <p>In recent years, data, which is demanded in parametric insurance solutions, can be more easily obtainable and accuracy of catastrophe modelling is increasing, parametric insurance is becoming more attractive for companies and organizations with greater balance sheet risk. We will see more robust parametric insurance solutions to be developed in the future.</p><br>
                    <p>Another reason parametric insurance will continue to be more attractive is that it is proven that there is an increasing trend for exposure to higher frequency of natural disasters. On the other hand, traditional insurance is losing popularity as it is less customizable and has higher rates.</p><br>
